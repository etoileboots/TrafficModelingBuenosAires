**Abstract**

This project presents an advanced traffic flow model developed for Minerva University's CS166 course, focusing on simulating and analyzing traffic congestion within urban networks. The model, based on a traffic network simulation, incorporates key principles from Nagel and Schreckenberg (1992) to enhance accuracy in representing vehicle movement and congestion. Initial model iterations utilized simple parameters and updating rules, but limitations were identified, such as unrealistic assumptions about road traversal and congestion management. 
The updated model employs refined congestion metrics and improved visualization techniques, offering better insight into traffic flow dynamics. It incorporates microscopic behavior to simulate car speeds and movements more realistically, addresses traffic jam dynamics, and uses betweenness centrality to predict congestion-prone roads. Empirical results from simulations in Berlin and Buenos Aires validate the model, showing that betweenness centrality effectively predicts high congestion areas, especially in networks with significant connectivity bottlenecks.
The findings suggest that while betweenness centrality is a valuable metric, it should be used in conjunction with other factors for comprehensive traffic management and infrastructure planning. The study underscores the importance of detailed traffic modeling for optimizing urban traffic systems and improving overall transportation efficiency.
